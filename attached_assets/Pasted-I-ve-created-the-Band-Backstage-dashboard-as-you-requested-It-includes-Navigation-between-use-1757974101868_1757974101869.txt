I've created the Band Backstage dashboard as you requested. It includes:

‚úì Navigation between user dashboard and band backstage
‚úì Band header with name and avatar
‚úì Next event card showing upcoming performances
‚úì Four main feature cards for Playbook, Setlists, Song Pipeline, and Events
‚úì Band Profile and Messages sections for management
‚úì Notification badge for unread messages

You can test it by clicking on one of the band tiles on the dashboard. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the design or functionality?

Lets change music management to song management. Now, I neeed help with a concept. Bands have public events and private events. Private events will be practice, meetings, recordings, private bookings. Public events will be Gigs/Shows booked at a venue. For public events, we will have a separate interface that will show these on a map for public viewing. For these events, a band may want to add a poster, ticket links, post event videos. I was thinking that we keep a calendar view, which would show these events and the band can add a public/private toggle when creating a new event. But then we also have a new area for Events/Gigs? In here, we get a list view of public gigs/events and the ability to create new (don't implement now). Creating an event will be very slick, just venue & date is needed, things like description, start time, ticket links etc will be optional and also editable once an event has been created. But the band members may also want to associate a setlist to a gig, add performance notes or a gig sheet that details arrival time, venue layout, equipment needed etc etc. Can you consider UX options for this please, or challenge me if it doen't make sense?

I like your concept and have some UX suggestions for managing band events. Let me first address the "Music Management" to "Song Management" change, then provide recommendations for your events system.

Event Management Concept
Based on your requirements, here's how I'd approach the event management system:

1. Dual-Purpose Calendar View
Keep your existing calendar for all events (public and private)
Use visual indicators (colors, icons) to distinguish public from private events
Add a simple toggle filter to show "All Events", "Public Only", or "Private Only"
2. Separate "Gigs" Section
I recommend creating a dedicated "Gigs" area from your Events icon in the attached image. This would focus exclusively on public performances and provide:

List View: Chronological list of upcoming public gigs only
Map View: Geographic visualization of gigs (for the public interface)
Archive View: Past gigs with associated media/memories
3. Event Creation Flow
For the "slick" creation process:

Quick Create: Just venue & date as you suggested
Progressive Disclosure: After initial creation, expose additional options:
Basic Info (description, time, ticket links)
Media (poster, promotional images)
Performance Details (setlist selection, stage plot)
Logistics (load-in time, equipment needs, contact info)
4. Event Connectedness
Connect your events to other parts of the app:

Link to selected setlist
Connect to a "Gig Sheet" document with all logistics details
Post-event: Link to media uploads, reviews, attendance data
UX Recommendations
Calendar + Details Pattern: Use a split-view where selecting an event in the calendar reveals details on the side

Event States & Lifecycle:

Proposed (not confirmed)
Confirmed (basic details complete)
Promoted (public details added)
Completed (post-event content added)
Differentiated Icons:

Practice: üéµ
Meeting: üë•
Recording: üéôÔ∏è
Private Booking: üîí
Public Gig: üé≠
Festival: üé™
Public Event Details:
Design a "promo card" template with:

Event poster
Date, time, venue
Ticket link
Supporting acts
Social sharing buttons
Would you like me to implement any of these suggestions now, or would you prefer to refine the concept further?

Makes sense. Lets go ahead with 1. 2 yes, but no need for mapview, that will be done elsewhere. 3 - yes. 4 - yes, but don't need to implment just yet. Lets also ensure we're maintaining a consistent theme with these new graphics / iconography. Core colours are the dark blue, oraange and then an electric blue. But plezase feel frree to add other accent colours that we can learn to associate with different areas.

I'll implement the requested changes to enhance the band event management system while maintaining a consistent theme with the core colors (dark blue, orange, and electric blue) along with appropriate accent colors. Let's start by: 1. Changing "Music Management" to "Song Management" in the backstage page 2. Setting up the foundation for the dual-purpose calendar with filters for public/private events 3. Creating the dedicated "Gigs" section (without map view) 4. Establishing the quick event creation flow First, let's update the backstage page:

The "Band" section (clicking on any band)
Try to add a new event with the public/private toggle?
I prefered the previous band backstage layout with 2 tiles on a row. We don't need the tabs on here. Lets go back to the previous grouping. One area for Song Management, with childern being Playbook, Setlist and Pipeline. Pipeline is where they vote on new suggestions and manage a practice list/status. Then an area for Calendar & Gigs. You've over complicated the dashboard with this version. We also need to always maintain the hedaer bar with bndy logo and burger menu that may have actions/notifications, as well as the consistent active band profile header once you're in a band context.

‚úì Created consistent band profile header with avatar
‚úì Grouped Song Management tools (Playbook, Setlists, Pipeline)
‚úì Kept Calendar & Gigs together as requested
‚úì Added only relevant upcoming gigs and practice sessions

Does this look better? Is there anything else you'd like to adjust about the Band Backstage page?

Ok, better, but I still liked the individual tiles inside the main categories. Calendar & Gigs, Song Management, Members, Settings. The last 2 won't have children. But the first 2, we can split into 2 columns or tiles, as original version. Still edge to edge. In Calendar & Gigs lets add an obvious button to create new, lets move that from the header. In songs, lets add an obvious button ao Add Song (may this is the 4th Song Management tile to make it even??? Whatever is good consistent UX. I don't think we need a "Access ....." button either. Each tile should be clickable and have a hover state. Can you revamp this please, not only just using my notes here but also a fresher approach.

Restructure main backstage area into grouped tiles for key features
This checkpoint cost $0.25
I've completely revamped the Band Backstage page with a fresh approach:

‚úì Created main categories (Calendar & Gigs, Song Management, Members, Settings)
‚úì Each category now has 4 interactive tiles in a grid layout
‚úì Added dedicated "action" tiles for creating new items (Add Gig, Create Event, Add Song)
‚úì Made all tiles clickable with hover effects
‚úì Used gradient headers for each main category
‚úì Maintained the consistent header with bndy logo and navigation

How does this look? Do you like this tile-based approach with visual cues for actions?

No, a couple of issues. 1 - in mobile view, the tiles should be moving to 2 columns, so I have square tiles. In Calendar & Gigs, there will just be 2 square tiles on a single row. In Song Management, we will have 3 tiles on 2 rows and a blank space. Now, the Add Event/Song should be a button in those areas. Previously, you designed a circular + button to add an event. Similar to the attached. We still have "Create >" links. We shouldn't need to explicility state the action in good UX. If we place a button correctly, they should know they're adding an event or song, depending on context, right? I feel we're losing the thread a bit here.

‚úì Maintained color coordination for each section
‚úì Simplified the overall interface

Is this what you were looking for with the "Add" button in the section header? Any other adjustments needed?

Hmmm, I think those buttons are ok in desktop view, but in mobile it looks a bit MEH. What can you do to make teh mobile view more appealing & cleaner? Maybe just a circular add button with no text? Please don't just take my notes, also suggest best mobile optimised UX.

You're right - we can definitely improve the mobile experience. A modern mobile UI often uses floating action buttons (FABs) for primary actions. Let me implement a responsive design that optimizes for both desktop and mobile:

I've completely revamped the mobile experience with several modern design patterns:

‚úì Enhanced tile designs with subtle highlights and improved spacing
‚úì Improved typography with better scale and line clamping
‚úì Added a slight shadow effect for depth and visual hierarchy
‚úì Used color coordination consistent with the original design
‚úì Added subtle animations and hover effects

The design now follows mobile-first best practices with FAB (Floating Action Button) on small screens and standard buttons on desktop. How does this mobile-optimized design look now?

If there is an odd number of tiles, we can make the first one full width. EG - Playbook, Band Members and Band Profile will be full width. But ensure that this is dynamic in case we add more.

That's a great suggestion! I'll update the code to make the first tile full width when there's an odd number of tiles. This will create a more balanced layout and give prominence to the most important feature in each category:

‚úì This applies only to small screens - on tablet and desktop everything is in a grid
‚úì The layout automatically adjusts based on the number of tiles
‚úì This creates a more balanced layout especially for the sections with 1 or 3 tiles
‚úì The floating "+" button is still present for mobile and regular buttons for desktop

How does this layout look? The grid should appear balanced in both mobile and desktop views now.

‚úì First tile spans full width on mobile when there's an odd number of items in a section
‚úì Maintained a clean grid layout for tablet and desktop views
‚úì Improved the visual consistency across all tiles
‚úì All tiles have the same height now, creating a more professional look

How does the layout look now? The first tile should span full width on mobile for sections with odd numbers of items, but all tiles should maintain the same height.

Expane collapse is good. On User dashboard - can you change this event date so its today? Then we should see the effect?? Also, add a gig for the band in the data that is also todays date.

Fantastic. Now, help me implment the songs section. A user should be able to add a new song by title, with autocomplete. In the live implementation we will use spotify for this, but for now you could use any other source. I have a spotify API key if you want to do that now but I don't want it to be a blocker for our implmentation. Once in band context, users can add songs. These will go into the bands songlist as suggestions. We then need a list view with song cards where a user can view all suggestions. Any questions?

Transition Effects
When switching between views:

Fade Transition:

Content fades out with opacity animation (150ms)
Skeleton placeholders fade in (100ms)
New content gradually fades in after data loads (200ms)
Progress Indicator:

A subtle loading bar appears at the top of the page during navigation
The bar fills from left to right with a slight pulsing animation
When complete, it briefly flashes before disappearing
Element Staggering:

Elements load with a subtle staggered timing (20-30ms delay between items)
Loading starts from top to bottom and left to right
Gives a sense of content progressively filling in
The skeleton components use a subtle gradient animation with a pulsing effect, moving from left to right with a slight shimmer to indicate loading activity. The color of these skeletons matches the theme (lighter gray in light mode, darker gray in dark mode), maintaining visual consistency.

Would you like me to enhance any particular aspect of these loading animations, or would you like me to implement additional loading effects in specific areas of the application?
