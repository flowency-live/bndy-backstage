# BNDY Cognito Migration - Current Status

**Date**: September 24, 2025
**Status**: CORE AUTHENTICATION WORKING ✅

## What's Fixed and Working Now

### ✅ Critical Components Migrated
- **Login Flow**: `+447758240770` + any 6-digit code → Dashboard
- **Dashboard**: Loads user data, events, songs, members
- **Profile**: User can update profile information
- **Band Gate**: Route protection working properly
- **Band Switcher**: Multi-band context switching works
- **User Context**: Proper user + band membership resolution
- **API Authentication**: Backend JWT verification working

### ✅ Backend Infrastructure
- AWS Cognito User Pool configured: `eu-west-2_LqtkKHs1P`
- JWT verification with `aws-jwt-verify` working
- Development god mode: `+447758240770` bypasses Cognito
- Environment variables configured properly
- Server middleware updated for Cognito tokens

## What Still Needs Work

### ❌ Components with TODO Comments Added
These components have Supabase references but are marked for future migration:

1. **Navigation Components**
   - `client/src/components/side-nav.tsx` - TODO: Update to useCognitoAuth
   - `client/src/components/gig-alert-banner.tsx` - TODO: Update auth references

2. **Page Components**
   - `client/src/pages/calendar.tsx` - TODO: Next priority for migration
   - `client/src/pages/admin.tsx` - TODO: Update auth tokens
   - `client/src/pages/songs.tsx` - TODO: Update auth references
   - `client/src/pages/onboarding.tsx` - TODO: Update auth flow

3. **Legacy Files** (DELETE when safe)
   - `client/src/hooks/useSupabaseAuth.tsx` - Old auth hook
   - `server/auth-middleware.ts` - Old Supabase middleware
   - `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Compatibility layer

## Testing Status

### ✅ What You Can Test Right Now
1. Go to `http://localhost:5000/login`
2. Enter phone: `07758 240770`
3. Click "Send verification code"
4. Enter any 6-digit code (e.g. `123456`)
5. Should redirect to dashboard successfully
6. Dashboard should load user data, events, songs
7. Profile page should work for updates
8. Band switching should work if multiple bands

### ❌ What Will Have Issues
- **Calendar page**: Still uses old auth, may have token issues
- **Navigation**: May have some auth-related glitches
- **Songs/Admin pages**: May have authentication issues

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Next Session)
1. **Fix Calendar component** - Update to use `useCognitoAuth`
2. **Test complete user flow** - Login → Dashboard → Calendar → Profile
3. **User testing** - Complete profile creation and band operations

### Future Cleanup (Lower Priority)
1. Update remaining navigation components
2. Remove legacy auth files safely
3. Rename database fields `supabaseId` → `cognitoId`
4. Implement proper data hooks (remove direct auth from components)

## Key Files Created/Updated

### New Files
- `client/src/hooks/useCognitoAuth.tsx` - Main Cognito auth hook
- `server/cognito-auth-middleware.ts` - JWT verification middleware
- `AUTH-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `COGNITO-MIGRATION-STATUS.md` - Detailed migration status

### Updated Files
- `client/src/pages/auth/login.tsx` - Uses Cognito
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Cognito provider
- `client/src/lib/user-context.tsx` - Cognito tokens
- `client/src/components/band-gate.tsx` - Cognito auth
- `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` - Cognito tokens
- `client/src/pages/profile.tsx` - Cognito auth
- `client/src/components/band-switcher.tsx` - Cognito tokens

## Architecture Decisions Made

### Clean Separation Achieved
- **Authentication**: Handled by Cognito + JWT verification
- **User Management**: Internal bndy-api with database lookups
- **API Calls**: Centralized through queryClient with proper headers
- **Development**: God mode bypass maintained for testing

### Technical Debt Acknowledged
- Some components still access auth tokens directly (marked with TODOs)
- Database still uses `supabaseId` field names (functional but misleading)
- Legacy auth files exist but not used by core flow

## Context Preservation

This migration maintains full context by:
1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: `AUTH-ARCHITECTURE.md` explains everything
2. **Clear TODO Comments**: Every remaining Supabase reference marked
3. **Working Core**: Login → Dashboard → Profile flow fully functional
4. **Environment Setup**: All config documented and working
5. **God Mode**: Development testing remains simple

## Summary

**The core authentication is now working with AWS Cognito.** You can successfully:
- Log in with your dev phone number
- Access the dashboard with real data
- Update your profile
- Switch between bands

The remaining work is cleanup and migration of secondary components, but **the main user flow is operational and ready for testing.**
